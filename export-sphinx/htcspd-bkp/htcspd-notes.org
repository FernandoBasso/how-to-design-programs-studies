* DONE [13/13] 1a: Beginning Student Language

These are *expressions*:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(+ 3 4)
(+ (* 2 3) (/ 10 5))

;; Even simple numbers or strings are expressions
3.14
"May the force be with you."
#+END_SRC

~sqr~, ~sqrt~, etc.

*** Exercise 1:
: (sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4))

i1.412135... is an irrational number. It can't be written as a/b, where a and b are integers; that means its decimal representation is infinitely long (and not repeating like the decimal of 1/3). It would take all memory to store it. It is pretty close to that, but not exactly, perfectly that number.

Average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers there are.

~(/ 10 3)~ divides 10 by 3, and not 3 by then. Like wise:
(- 10 3) subctracts 3 from 10, not 10 from 3.


** DONE Evaluation

: (+ 2 (* 3 4) ( - (+ 1 2) 3))

It starts with a primitive operation. It is called a *primitive call* or *call to a primitive*.

Operator --> operands. It may have nested primivive calls with operators and operands.
All operands must first be reduced to values, then apply primitive to values.

Evaluations from left to right, from the inside to the outside.


** DONE Strings and Images, pt 1

Strings and images are considered primitives.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle :results output :exports both
"Racket!"
(string-append "Ada" " " "Lovelace")
(substring "how are you" 4 7)
#+END_SRC

Strings are zero-based indexed. Watch out for off-by-one errors.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle :results output :exports both
(define str "What?")
(substring str (- (string-length str) 1))
#+END_SRC


** DONE Strings and Images, pt 2

NOTE: The ~require~ line doesn't produce a value. It is just a declaration.

: (require 2htdp/image)
: (circle 20 "solid" "magenta")
: (rectangle 25 25 "outline" "pink")
: (text "Hello!" 24 "orange")

: (above (circle 15 "solid" "yellow")
:        (circle 20 "solid" "orange")
:        (circle 25 "solid" "maroon"))

Tray with ~beside~, ~overlay~.

: (overlay (text "STOP!" 42 "white")
:          (regular-polygon 60 8 "solid" "red"))

: (beside (square 20 "outline" "blue")
:         (above (circle 15 "solid" "red")
:                (triangle 20 "solid" "green")))


** DONE Constant Definitions, pt 1

Images are values and valures are expressions.

In DrRacket (perhaps emacs) you can do

: define CAT <paste an image here>
: (rotate -10 CAT)
: (rotate  10 CAT)

: (define RCAT (rotate -10 CAT))
: (define LCAT (rotate  10 CAT))
: LCAT
: RCAT

: (define FOO (* 2 3))
: (define BAR (* FOO 2))
: (* FOO BAR)


** DONE Constant Definitions, pt 2

A 20-second long video talking about the importance of defining things with names.


** DONE Function Definitions, pt. 1

A lot of this never changes... Only colors vary.
: (above (circle 40 "solid" "red")
:        (circle 40 "solid" "yellow")
:        (circle 40 "solid" "green"))


: ;; Define a function that takes the color.
: (define (bulb c)
:   (circle 40 "solid" c))
:
: ;; Invokes the function passing the color as parameter.
: (bulb "purple")
:
: ;; Invokes the function thrice a different color each time.
: (above (bulb "red") (bulb "yellow") (bulb "green"))

A function that will give the length of the hypotenuse of any right angle triangle.

: (define (pythag a b)
:   (sqrt (+ (sqr a) (sqr b))))
:
: (pythag 3 4)


** DONE Function Definitions, pt 2


To define a function (look at how parensthesis are used, where they are opened and closed):

: (define (<function name> <arg 1> ... <arg n>)
:   (<expression>)

Expression form the body of the function.

To CALL/INVOKE/RUN/EXECUTE a function:

: (<name-of-a-defined-function> <expression>)

Example:

: ;; Define
: (define (bulb c)
:   (circle 20 "solid" c))
:
: ;; Call!
: (bulb (string-append "mag" "enta"))

The expressions that are the parameters to the function are operands.

*** DONE Function Evaluation Rules

For function definition:
- Simply record the definition (put it in memory)

To evaluate a function call:
- reduce operands/arguments to values
- replace function call by
  - body of function in which every occurrence of parameters are replaced by corresponding argument.

: (define (foo a b)
:    (+ (* 3 a)b (* b a)))

Called as ~(foo (+ 1 1) 4)~. Evaluation is:

Still the function call
: (foo 2 4)

Replace the call with the body of foo, with operands reduced to values.
: (+ (* 3 2) 4 (* 4 2))

Then
: (+ 6 4 (* 4 2))

Then
: (+ 6 4 8)

Finally
: 18


** DONE Booleans and if Expressions, pt 1

Booleans are primitive as well.

: (define WIDTH 100)
: (define HEIGHT 100)
:
: (> WIDTH HEIGHT)
: (>= WIDTH HEIGHT)

*** Predicates

Predicates are primitive functions that produce a boolean value.
~>~, ~>=~ and similar operators are known as *predicates*.

~string=?~ is also a predicate.
: (string=? "foo" "Foo")
: #false


: (define IMG1 (rectangle 10 20 "solid" "red"))
: (define IMG2 (rectangle 20 18 "solid" "blud"))
: (< (image-width IMG1) (image-width IMG2))
: #true

** DONE Booleans and if Expressions, pt 2

Always three expressions.

: (if <expr>            ;; question (must produce a boolean)
:     <expr>            ;; true answer, the "then" clause
:     <expr>)           ;; false answer, the "else" clause


: (if (< (image-width IMG1) (image-height IMG1))
:     "Image is tall."
:     "Image is wide.")


** DONE Booleans and if Expressions, pt 3

Evaluation:
- if the question expression is not a value, evaluate it and replace with value.
- if the question is true replace entire if expression with true/then expression.
- if the question is false replace entire if expression with false/else expression.
- if question produces a value other than a boolean so produce an error.


** DONE Booleans and if Expressions, pt 4 - AND

Check if an image is both wider and taller than some other image.

: (require 2htdp/image)
: (define I1 (rectangle 10 20 "solid" "red"))
: (define I2 (rectangle 20 10 "solid" "blue"))
: (and (> (image-height I1) (image-height I2))
: (< (image-width I1) (image-width I2)))

~and~ only evaluates until it finds a false value. It shortcircuits.

There is also ~or~ and ~not~.

** DONE Exercises - Recommended Problems

*** Simple Arithmetic Expressions

more-arithmetic-expression-starter.rkt

Write two expressions that multiply the numbers 3, 5 and 7.
The first should take advantage of the fact that * can accept more than 2 arguments.
The second should build up the result by first multiplying 3 times 5 and then multiply theresult of that by 7.

: (* 3 5 7)
: (* (* 3 5) 7)

1) IMAGE1 is taller than IMAGE2
2) IMAGE1 is narrower than IMAGE2
3) IMAGE1 has both the same width AND height as IMAGE2

Now we actually start learning the design method.

HtDF: How to Desgin Functions

** DONE Module Overview



** DONE Full Speed HtDF Recipe

HtDF makes it easier to solve harder problems, but it is cumbersome to solve simpler ones. Still, we use simpler problems to learn the methodology so we can easily apply it to complex situations later.


** DONE Slow Motion HtDF Recipe

: ; Design a function that consumes a number and produces twice that number.
: ; Call your function double. Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented
: ; out versions of the stub and template.
:
: ;; Number -> Number
: ;; Produces 2 times the given number
: (check-expect (double 3) 6)
: (check-expect (double 4.2) (* 2 4.2))
:
: ;(define (double n) 0) ; This is th stub.
:
: ;(define (double n) ;this is the template.
: ;  (... n))
:
: (define (double n)
:   (* 2 n))


*** DONE Peer Question
: (define WIDTH 100)
: (define HEIGHT 100)
:
: (define (half-tw x)
:   (+ x (/ (- WIDTH x) 2)))
:
: ;; Number -> Number
: ;; Given a y coordinate, produce y coord half way between it and HEIGHT
: (check-expect (half-th 0) (/ HEIGHT 2))
: (check-expect (half-th 20) (+ 20 (/ (- HEIGHT 20) 2)))
:
: (define (half-th y)
:   (+ y (/ (- HEIGHT y) 2)))


** DONE A Simple Practice Example (simple pluralizer)

: ;; Design a function that pluralizes a given word. (Pluralize
: ;; means to convert the word to its plural form.) For
: ;; simplicity you may assume that just adding s is enough to
: ;; pluralize a word.
:
: ;; String -> String
: ;; Given a string, add s to the end of it.
: (check-expect (pluralize "car") "cars")
: (check-expect (pluralize "girl") "girls")
: (check-expect (pluralize "fuss") "fusss")
:
: ;(define (pluralize word) "") ;stub
: ;
: ;(define (pluralize word) ;template
: ;  (... word))
:
: (define (pluralize word)
:   (string-append word "s"))

*** Example - yell!!

DESIGN a function called yell that consumes strings like "hello" and adds "!" to produce strings like "hello!".

Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.

: ;; String -> String
: ;; Add “!” to the end of str.
: (check-expect (yell "Hello") "Hello!")
: (check-expect (yell "bye") "bye!")
: (check-expect (yell "!") "!!")
:
: ;(define (yell str) "")    ;stub
:
: ;(define (yell str)        ;template
: ;  (... str))
:
: (define (yell str)
:   (string-append str "!"))

*** Repeat string

: ;; String -> String
: ;; Duplicate a string (add a space and then a string itself). "" produces "".
: (check-expect (repeat "foo") "foo foo")
: (check-expect (repeat "") "")
:
: ;(define (repeat str) "")   ;stub
:
: ;(define (repeat str)       ;template
: ;  (... str))
:
: (define (repeat str)
:   (if (string=? str "")
:       ""
:       (string-append str " " str)))



** DONE When Tests are Incorrect

file:./part01b/area-tests.rkt
#+INCLUDE: "./part01b/area-tests.rkt" src scheme

When a test fails, it could be that:
- the function definition is wrong
- the test is wrong
- both are wrong

Check the tests carefully before trying to fix function definitions. If the test is wrong and you make the function conform to it, you'll end up with a function that produces wrong results.

** DONE Varying Recipe Order

You can vary the order of the HtDF steps. It is not a strict waterfall process (although you should try as much as possible stick with it).

Sometimes you start a signature as ~Image -> Number~, and later you realize it is best to have it ~Image -> Natural~. We want signatures to be as specific as possible.

file:./part01b/image-area.rkt
#+INCLUDE: "./part01b/image-area.rkt" src scheme


** DONE Poorly Formed Problems

*DESIGN* is the process of going from a poorly formed problem to a well structured solution.

Functions that produce a boolean have a name that ends with a question mark.

How many tests does a certain function needs to cover “all” possibilities?

Code coverage should be 100%. Boundary conditions/corner cases.

* DONE 4a - Self-Reference

cons, first, rest empty, empty?

Well-formed self-reference:
- at least one base case;
- at least one self-reference case;

The self-reference template rule puts a natural recursion in the template that corresponds to the self-reference in the type comment.

Test the base case first because it is simpler and because non-base case stuff tend to rely on the base case.
