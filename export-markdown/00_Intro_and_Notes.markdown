1. Add the repos to .emacs or init.el as described in

   <https://melpa.org/#/getting-started>.

2. Run `M-x RET package-refresh-contents RET` (they don't mention it

   in the tutorial).

3. Run `M-x RET package-install geiser RET`.


Geiser info pages:

	C-h i m Geiser RET

Read about installation notes for [Chicken Scheme stuff](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/geiser_2.html#Installation).

	M-x run-geiser

Open a ``.rkt`` file in Emacs. Whether you have Geiser repl running or not, hit ``C-c C-a`` and all functions and other definitions inside the ``.rkt`` file will be available for use in the Geiser REPL.

In geiser REPL you can do

	(enter! "foo.rkt")
	(enter! "projs/main.rkt")


to load code on those files into the REPL. It seems the files must start with **``#lang racket``** or some thing like that.  Or, if you are editing a ``.rkt`` file and want to "enter" it into the REPL:

	C-c C-a

üìñÔ∏è Teaching Languages ‚Äî htdp/bsl
--------------------------------

	#lang htdp/bsl

<https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode/issues/125][Topic%20about%20images%20in%20htdp/bsl%20that%20shows%20some%20useful%20things.> May come in handy at some point.

To run tests like those with ``check-expect``, your ``.rkt`` file must start with one of these (beginner/intermediate/advanced student languages. The ‚Äú+‚Äù a few more features.

	#lang htdp/bsl
	#lang htdp/bsl+
	#lang htdp/isl
	#lang htdp/isl+
	#lang htdp/asl

or

``#reader(lib "htdp-beginner-reader.ss" "lang")((modname area-tests) (read-case-sensitive #t) (teachpacks ()) (htdp-settings #(#t constructor repeating-decimal #f #t none #f () #f)))``

Emacs, Geiser
-------------
``C-u C-c C-z`` or ``C-c C-a`` brings one to the REPL in the current module/file. It DISPLAY IMAGES! üíñÔ∏è

``C-c C-k`` runs fine with the http languages (``C-c C-a`` ~~does not work for the teaching languages~~).

But not both.

Then, from ``racket-mode``, do ``C-c C-t`` (runs ``racket-test`` and be happy. From the command line,

	$ raco test file.rkt

Thanks to lexi-lambada@racket (irc). He refused to change his nick to lexi-Œª as I suggested, though.

Other libs used in the book
---------------------------


* [2htdp/image](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html) ‚Üí ``bitmap``
* [2htdp/universe](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html) ‚Üí ``animate``



DrRacket
--------


* [DrRacket Keyboard Shortcuts](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/Keyboard_Shortcuts.html) (Emacs!!! ‚≠êÔ∏è)

``C-x o`` to move from interactions to definition window.

**TIP**: To use ``(bitmap "../images/foo.png")`` make sure the file is saved so the relative path works, otherwise, with an unsaved buffer, DrRacket will try to load images relative to your home directory.

**WARNING**: If you paste/insert images through Racket's UI, or your you set the language through the UI, you end up with unreadable source code files. Use a header like one of these and see the next tip about ‚ÄúDetermine language from source‚Äù.

**TIP**: To allow the line ``#lang htdp/<some language>``, make sure ‚Äúdetermine language from source‚Äù is selected in DrRacket's bottom left corner.

**TIP**: On wide screens, you may find it useful to display the interactions pane on the right side (instead of at the bottom). Go to ‚ÄúView ‚Üí Use Horizontal Layout‚Äù. There is a setting in Preferences too.
