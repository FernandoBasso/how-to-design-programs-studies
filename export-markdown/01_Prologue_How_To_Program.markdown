Strings are lists of chars in double quotes.

``+`` and ``string-append`` are operations. Both can handle as many operands as desired.

*Primitives*, also called *pre-defined* or built-in.

	(+ (string-length "FP") 1)
	;; → 3


	#lang htdp/bsl
	(require 2htdp/image)
	
	(define ROCKET (bitmap "../images/rocket.png"))
	
	ROCKET

The ORIGIN is at position (0, 0) on the scene:

	(place-image (circle 5 "solid" "green")
	             50 80
	             (empty-scene 100 100))
