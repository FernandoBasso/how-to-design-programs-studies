## File Naming

Files are named numerically so that I can review them in the order I wrote them. I imagine I'll not have more than 999 files by the end of the book (if I do, I'll add a fourth digit to the names with `perl-rename` or something).

All files start with “e” (for example or exercise), followed by an incremental three digit sequence, like 001, 002, etc. Then, if it is an example from the book it has a “e-<some descriptive name>” (“e” stands for example), and if it is an exercise, “p<exercise number>-<some descriptive name>” (“p” for practice problem/program). Example:

- `e001e-hello.rkt`: first file written, and example from the book.
- `e002e-sum.rkt`: second file written, and another example from the book.
- `e003p1-add-nums.rkt`: third file written; first exercise, practice problem to be solved by the student.
- `e004e-consts.rkt`: fourth file written and another example from the book.
- `e005p2-say-hello.rkt`: fifth file written; the second exercise/practice problem to be solved by the student.

**NOTE**: The names above are made up, not the actual name of the first files in the repo.
